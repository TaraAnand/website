  <p>We're thrilled you're interested in joining us! Here at CORE, we’re ground zero for entrepreneurship at CU. Our mission: to inspire, educate, and launch the next wave of Columbia’s entrepreneurs. Whether you are passionate about technology, have dreams of building a company, or would just like to work for yourself, becoming a part of the CORE team is one of the best first steps you can take. There is much to do, and we’d love to have you join us.<br><br> Below you will find application links to apply to our CORE Operating Team and/or our media outlet, CORE Impulse. For a snapshot of what we’re currently up to, check out <a href="/infographic"> our interactive CORE initiatives page.</a></span></p>

  <h3>Apply to be a CORE Operating Committee Leader (OCL) </h3>
  <p>We do our best to run CORE like a startup, and like a startup, we want all our members - even our new Operating Committee Leaders - to feel a sense of ownership in CORE as a whole. Thus, when new CORE members start out as OCLs, they are given significant responsibility from the first day. OCLs will immediately get to jump on board with the CORE projects they find interesting, and help guide them to success in the coming year. We also love it when our OCLs seize initiative and build a new program in CORE to claim as their own. Many of our best programs -  the Startup Internship Program, Global Tech Treks, and Women@CORE to name a few - began as the projects of intrepid OCLs! Of course, there will always be nitty gritty details of event planning and management to plow through, but our new members will be working alongside executive board members doing just the same. Ultimately, it is the enthusiasm, ambition, and insanely high amounts of energy of each new OCL class that keeps CORE going, and to every new, hard-working OCL, we promise you'll get just as much out as you put in! </p>
